<h2>Objectives</h2>

This project is the replacement of the final exam. You will be asked to design and complete a java program with the skills and concepts learnt from CSIT121.

Backgroun

<strong><u>Café Food Ordering System</u></strong>

You are required to design and implement a simple Café Food Ordering System based on the above menu. The detailed requirements are as follows:




<ul>

 <li>The system shall be design by using the object-oriented programming concepts introduced in CSIT121 and implement by using the Java programming language.</li>

 <li>The OOP principle such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstract class/method, interface shall be employed in the development of the system.</li>

 <li>The system shall have a GUI. Customers can input name and the table number as the identification on the top of the GUI. The GUI shall be able to show all the information from the above menu, such as the type, the name, the price, and the extra information of each dish.</li>

 <li>Customers can add any dish to the order. The system shall display the price and quantity of each dish, and automatically update the total price based on the size and the quantity of all dishes.</li>

 <li>Customers can reset their orders any time before they submit it. When the order is reset, the cart will be empty and the total price will be reset to zero.</li>

 <li>Once customers submit the order, the order will be saved as a text file (named as</li>

</ul>

“customerName_tableID.txt”. The text file shall clearly show all the details of the order, including the customer name, table ID, each dish name, size and quantity and price, and the total order price with a reasonable format.

<ul>

 <li>The system shall able to check the validation of user’s input and order, and ask the user to reinput invalid information.</li>

</ul>

<strong><u>Sample Solution:</u></strong>

The sample solution demonstrates the procedure of using the system to complete an order. Your graphic user interface can have different design from the sample solution. (Please remove the words “Fenghui’s Solution” in your program.

<ol>

 <li>Graphic User Interface</li>

 <li>Add the first dish</li>

 <li>Add more dishes</li>

</ol>

<strong> </strong>

<ol start="5">

 <li>Submit the order and save the order as a txt file.</li>

</ol>




<strong><u>Tasks </u></strong>

This project contains several tasks:

<ol>

 <li>UML class diagram: You shall draw a UML class diagram to illustrate the class design of your system. In the UML class diagram, you shall clearly specify the class name, fields, methods, associations and multiplicities.</li>

 <li>Graphic User Interface (GUI): You shall design a GUI. The GUI design shall be compact and informative. All information included in the above menu shall be able to display within the GUI. Customers can use the GUI to make the selections and complete the order.</li>

 <li>Coding: You shall implement the classes and GUI based on the above designs and make sure all the requirements are met. The program shall able to handle exceptions with the try…catch block and avoid the runtime errors.</li>

 <li>Testing: You shall compile and test your system with same cases and procedure in the example to make sure the system is workable and tolerant to possible exceptions. (</li>
